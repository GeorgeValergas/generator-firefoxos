# Generator FirefoxOS

A Yeoman generator for **Firefox OS** apps.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
1. Install the generator **globally**: `npm install -g generator-firefoxos`
1. Run: `yo firefoxos`

Now you will have a Firefox OS app skeleton, ready to be deployed to
a device.

To install the app in a phone for the first time, run:

```bash
$ grunt push
$ grunt reset
```
